# Labeling-Tool_Matlab
Labeling Tool to get and add information of images
Requirement:
Use Matlab to write a program to label the images. 
In this process, we need to get the coordinate (x, y) of 14 parts of people’s body in the images. 
The body parts are right ankle, right knee, right hip, left hip, left knee, left ankle, right wrist, right elbow, right shoulder, left shoulder, left elbow, left wrist, neck, head top.
In addition, I need to record the information about people’s direction and sides. Here, direction means direction of the head to feet in the image. Two options: up to down (vertical), left to right (horizontal).Regrading with the lying direction, there are three options: lying flat, lying to left, lying to left.
